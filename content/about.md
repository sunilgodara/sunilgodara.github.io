Hello and welcome! My name is Sunil Kumar Godara, and I am an engineer and data scientist with over a decade of experience. What started as a curiosity in the applications of machine learning (ML) on sensor streams during my undergraduate degree quickly turned into a passion for solving complex problems with data. I have had the privilege of working in multiple industries such as consumer products, manufacturing, web hosting, mobility, and e-commerce, leveraging ML to address real-world challenges. As I continue to explore the latest developments in ML and AI, I look forward to sharing my insights and observations on this blog.
