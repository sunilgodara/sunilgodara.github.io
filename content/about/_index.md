I’m an Applied AI and ML practitioner focused on profit and risk use cases.

For ~12 years, I’ve been shipping models at places like Sixt, Wayfair and Publicis Sapient's clients. I don’t just build individual ML models <> I build systems that change prices, promises, and decisions in real-time.

My philosophy is simple:
1. Start with a clear problem statement.
2. Don't force deep learning where a regression (or a rule) will do.
3. Ensure the model behaves sensibly when the data gets noisy.

Selected Work:
* Revenue & Fleet: Dynamic pricing and utilization engines for mobility/rental sectors.
* Operations: Delivery date prediction that reacts to live supply chain constraints and special events.
* Risk: AI-driven customer screening for a large international bank.
* GenAI: Retrieval-based assistants to automate support and policy navigation.
